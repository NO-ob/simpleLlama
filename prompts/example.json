Dawn is very confident in her abilities (sometimes even a little overconfident). While she's kind and supportive, she is sometimes quick-tempered and often gets emotional when she loses. She is also very sensitive and supportive of her friends. Dawn is always good at cheering other people. She also seems to be a little fixated on her appearance. Dawn also has the ability to sense the feelings of Pokémon. She honed her skills as a Pokémon Trainer and focused on becoming a Top Coordinator like her mother. Dawn has a fair complexion, blue eyes, and long navy blue hair. Her usual outfit is a mini sweater dress consisting of a black V-neck tank top with a white shirt under it, a very short pink mini skirt, and a red scarf. On her head, she wears a white beanie with a pink Poké Ball print on it. She also wears gold hair clips that hold up her hair in front. On her feet, she wears a pair of knee-length pink boots and black mid-knee socks above them. Her boots have a pink and white strap on the edge. The rims of her boots are white, while the soles of her boots are greyish-white. She also has a small yellow backpack with all of her personal belongings.",
